# HorionGenerator V1.0.0
This is a fork of Tiger-Tom/HorionPyScripts, which is a discontinued project which generated NBTs for a lot of things. Now, I noticed that the copying co a clipboard did not work, so I did the next best thing- saving the NBTs a file, so that the user can copy the contents of it. This version saves to a set file and overwrites it. Newer versions will allow for setting a file name. 
# The Original Project
The project is located at `https://github.com/Tiger-Tom/HorionPyScripts`.

# How to Install
You will need Python, which is free and open source. Download it at `https://python.org/downloads`. Then, open the installer and install it. This should be pretty straightforward. Once you have installed Python, open the generator you would like to use. That's it!
# Where is is saved?
In the directory where the script is. So, if `BannerCreator.py` is located at `C:\This Directory`, the `banner.txt` file is located at `C:\This Directory`.
# How can I contribute?
You can fork this repo, edit it, and send a pull request. I can look into it and accept it or deny it. ==Please, don't remake the entire program without explaining why.==
# Can I donate?
**No.**
# How is progress?
See `progress.txt` for what is done, and what is to be done. Things that are done have had the save to file functionality added. The waiting projects have been untouched thus far. I wouldn't mind help with those.
# Future features
- [x] Save to file
- [ ] Save to file for all programs
- [ ] Choose file name
- [ ] Specific directory for the saved NBTs, to avoid clutter
- [ ] More NBT generators, perhaps from other command generator websites.
# Who are you?
Don't ask. I am a Python user. I know some Python. I will learn more and improve these. I did ==not== create these NBT generators. Some other guy did. See the original project.
