# HorionGenerator V1.0.0
This is a fork of Tiger-Tom/HorionPyScripts, which is a discontinued project which generated NBTs for a lot of things. Now, I noticed that the copying co a clipboard did not work, so I did the next best thing- saving to a file. This version saves to a set file and overwrites it. Newer versions will allow for setting a file name. 
# The Original Project
The project is located at https://github.com/Tiger-Tom/HorionPyScripts.

# How to Install
You will need Python, which is free and open source. Download it at https://python.org/downloads. Then, open the installer and install it. This should be pretty straightforward. Once you have installed Python, open the generator you would like to use. That's it!
# Where is is saved?
In the directory where the script is. So, if BannerCreator.py is located at C:\This Directory, the your_banner.txt file is located at C:\This Directory.
# How can I contribute?
You can fork this project, edit it, and send a pull request. I can look into it and accept it or deny it. Please, don't remake the entire program without explaining why.
# Can I donate?
No.
