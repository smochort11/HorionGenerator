## Horion Generator

Horion Generator is a fork of `https://github.com/Tiger-Tom/HorionPyScripts`, which contains Python scripts for generating some NBTs for the Horion Anarchy utility mod. This repo improves upon the now-discontinued Python scripts by allowing you to save them to a file, instead of copying to the clipboard. 

# Repository
The repo of this project is located at `https://github.com/smochort11/HorionGenerator` and already has a pre-release version there.

# Download 1.0.1 Beta
Click [here](https://github.com/smochort11/HorionGenerator/releases/download/beta2/HorionGenerator.b1.0.1.zip) to download v1.0.1 beta, which is the latest pre-release version of the Horion Generator. I plan upon Expanding upon this generator, as you should be abe to see [in the repo](https://github.com/Tiger-Tom/HorionPyScripts). 

# Why I made this project
The original project by Tiger-Tom has been discontinued in May of 2021. It also had, and still has, one major flaw. The copy to clipboard functionality that each and every script has did not work. It was flawed. I needed a solution.
So, I decided to research how to save variables to files. Which I did. Then, I forked the repo and downloaded the original one to begin my modification. This is the modified version.
